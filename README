NAME
    Acme::Mobile::Therbligs - count keystrokes to write mobile text
    messages

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Mobile::Therbligs;

      $thurbs = count_therbligs("See u l8r");

      # $thurbs == 23
  
DESCRIPTION
    This module counts the number of *therbligs* used to write mobile text
    messages. A therblig is unit used to measure the number of actions (in
    this case keypresses or pauses) for people who like to optimize
    industrial processes.

    So you can use this module to determine useless facts such as that it
    takes as many keypresses to write "later" or "great" as it does "l8r"
    and "gr8".

    See the module POD for more details.
